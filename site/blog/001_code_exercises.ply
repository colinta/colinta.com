        I've given and taken a few “code challenges” over the years, and I have
        found myself growing increasingly resentful towards the practice.
        Here's my thinking:

        First: Time Commitment.  Ideally the exercise covers a decent surface
        area; for instance a full stack role should be tested on backend and
        frontend development.  A small demo project that has a candidate build
        something that tests these core competences could easily take 6 hours.
        So just by having this kind of challenge as part of your hiring process,
        you are cutting out candidates who do not have this much spare time on
        their hands.

        Second: Providing useful metrics.  I took a programming challenge once
        that focused on _dates_, which has the terrible quality that the more
        you know about dates the _worse_ you would do.  Should these date
        functions support the missing days (which varies by country) when the
        world transitioned from the Julian to Gregorian calendar?  Should it
        account for leap seconds (which even our "perfect" Unix time system
        struggles with)?  And is this really a *core competency* that you want
        to measure?

        Third: Unit testing vs Integration testing.  Testing a candidate's
        coding ability doesn't really measure whether they will be a good
        _employee_, because it puts them in isolation, it doesn't provide any
        measure of how they would behave in a real-world work environment.

        So what to do instead?  I think that code exercises should be
        _discussed_.  I want to hire someone that can problem solve, or someone
        that can work well with other people to problem solve.  If they are
        super bright and knowledgeable I think that will be fairly obvious.  And
        if they are egomaniacal "My-way-or-you're-just-wrong" kind of brogrammer
        then hopefully that emerges, too.

        And since you are spending your own precious time for the interview, you
        are at least respecting your candidates' time committment, and you will
        be incentivized to minimize the amount of time wasted.
